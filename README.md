About Briefly

Briefly is a personalized news aggregation web app that delivers headlines, AI-powered summaries, and insights tailored to each user. The backend is built with Laravel 12, providing a robust foundation to handle articles, user interactions, ratings, tags, and conversational AI features.

Key features of Briefly include:

Expressive database ORM (Eloquent) – easy relationships between users, articles, ratings, tags, and conversations.

Schema migrations – version-controlled database structure that can evolve with the project.

API-first design – backend provides JSON endpoints for Vue or other frontends.

Background job processing – supports periodic clean-ups, digest emails, and AI summarization.

Flexible authentication – plans to use Sanctum for secure token-based access.

Briefly is designed to be scalable, modular, and adaptable, giving developers the tools needed for large, feature-rich applications.
